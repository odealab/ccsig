Coral Morphology	Definitions
Calice	Cup-shaped depression on corallite surface
Centers per Series	Number of corallites in a series/valley
Coenosteum	Skeleton between corallites within a colony
Columella 	Central axial structure within a corallite
Columella (Lamellar)	"Plate-like, parallel to valley"
Columella (Papillose)	Many small rods
Columella (Solid)	Central
Columella (Trabecular)	Formed by inner ends of septa
Coral Form	Overall shape of colony
Coral Form (Branching)	Flattened with calices on only one side
Coral Form (Massive)	Elongated projections
Coral Form (Platy)	Mound-shaped/Encrusting
Coral Shape	Corallite arrangement
Coral Shape (Cerioid)	"Cerioid: Juxtaposed and even, with own walls (those of massive corals share common walls)"
Coral Shape (Dendroid)	Dendroid: Branch from each other in dendritic pattern
Coral Shape (Fasciculate)	Fasciculate: Cylindrical but not in contact; may be dendroid (irregular branches) or phaceloid
Coral Shape (Flabelloid)	Flabelloid: Arranged in single series; adjacent valleys do not share ridges
Coral Shape (Flabello-meandroid a. k. a flabellate)	Flabello-meandroid a.k.a flabellate: Long meanderingrows with common base; walls may be partially fused
Coral Shape (Hydnophoroid)	Hydnophoroid: Cone-shaped protuberances between corallites
Coral Shape (Meandroid)	Meandroid: Arranged in multiple series; adjacent valleys share ridges
Coral Shape (Phaceloid)	Phaceloid: Separated by voided space; those with distinct walls separated by coenosteum
Coral Shape (Plocoid)	"Plocoid: Short-stalked and isolated, separated by coenosteum"
Coral Shape (Solitary)	Solitary: Entire coral = one corallite
Coral Shape (Subplocoid)	"Subplocoid: Sometimes separated by coenosteum, each with its own wall"
Coral Shape (Thamnasterioid)	"Thamnasterioid: Confluent septa of adjacent corallites, often twisted or sinuous"
Corallite	Skeleton of solitary individual or an individual within a colony
Costae	Extension of septum beyond wall
Paliform lobes	Exsert protuberance of septum at center of corallite
Septa	"Radially-arranged vertically partitions within a corallite (exsert, insert or even in regard to corallite wall)"
Septa-costae	Structure that flows between corallites when corallite walls are indistinct
Septal cycle	No. of types of septa with difference lengths and thickness
Septal granules	Small elevation on septa or septa teeth
Septal spacing	Spacing between septa/No. of septa per unit distance
Septal teeth	Sharp projections lining the upper margins of septa
Synapticulum	Conical or cylindrical supporting process extending between septa
Valley	A series of corallites
Wall	Vertical structure enclosing corallite
