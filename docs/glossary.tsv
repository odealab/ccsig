Coral Morphology	Definitions
Calice	Cup-shaped depression on corallite surface
Centers per Series	Number of corallites in a series/valley
Coenosteum	Skeleton between corallites within a colony
Columella (Central axial structure within a corallite)	Solid: Central
	Trabecular: Formed by inner ends of septa
	Papillose: Many small rods
	Lamellar: Plate-like, parallel to valley
Coral Form (Overall shape of colony)	Branching: Elongated projections
	Massive: Mound-shaped/Encrusting
	Platy: Flattened with calices on only one side
Coral Shape (Corallite arrangement)	Plocoid: Short-stalked and isolated, separated by coenosteum
	Subplocoid: Sometimes separated by coenosteum, each with its own wall
	Cerioid: Juxtaposed and even, with own walls (those of massive corals share common walls)
	Meandroid: Arranged in multiple series; adjacent valleys share ridges
	Flabelloid: Arranged in single series; adjacent valleys do not share ridges
	Flabello-meandroid a.k.a flabellate: Long meanderingrows with common base; walls may be partially fused
	Phaceloid: Separated by voided space; those with distinct walls separated by coenosteum
	Solitary: Entire coral = one corallite
	Dendroid: Branch from each other in dendritic pattern
	Thamnasterioid: Confluent septa of adjacent corallites, often twisted or sinuous
	Hydnophoroid: Cone-shaped protuberances between corallites
	Fasciculate: Cylindrical but not in contact; may be dendroid (irregular branches) or phaceloid
Corallite	Skeleton of solitary individual or an individual within a colony
Costae	Extension of septum beyond wall
Paliform lobes	Exsert protuberance of septum at center of corallite
Septa	Radially-arranged vertically partitions within a corallite (exsert, insert or even in regard to corallite wall)
Septa-costae	Structure that flows between corallites when corallite walls are indistinct
Septal cycle	No. of types of septa with difference lengths and thickness
Septal granules	Small elevation on septa or septa teeth
Septal spacing	Spacing between septa/No. of septa per unit distance
Septal teeth	Sharp projections lining the upper margins of septa
Synapticulum	Conical or cylindrical supporting process extending between septa
Valley	A series of corallites
Wall	Vertical structure enclosing corallite
